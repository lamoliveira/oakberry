This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand.

지식","faq-topic-1-question-1-ask":"아사이가 무엇인가요?","faq-topic-1-question-1-answer":"아사이는 브라질의 열대 우림에서 자라는 작고 짙은 보라색 열매입니다. 아사이는 어디서 재배되고 있는지에 대한 궁금증이 이어지겠죠? 아사이는 대부분 아마존 우림에 서식하는 유테르페 야자나무 (Euterpe palm)에서 생산됩니다. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e 아사이 과육( or 펄프)에는 활성 산소를 중화 시키는 천연 항산화제입니다. 칼륨, 칼슘과 같은 미네랄, 비타민 E, 오메가 6 및 오메가 9과 같은 이로운 지방산, 단백질이 포함되어 있습니다. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e 이 인기 있는 슈퍼 푸드는 전 세계적으로 수요가 증가함에 따라 강가 지역 사회의 주요 수입원이 되었습니다. 사람의 손으로 직접 열매를 선별 및 수확하며, 이는 고용 창출을 통해 지역 경제에 이바지하고 있습니다.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"아사이는 어떻게 발음하나요?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"아사이는 아-사-이이로 발음할 수 있습니다. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e 이 단어의 정확한 철자는 포르투갈어에서 유래된 \"Açaí\"입니다. 영어에서는 포르투갈어의 \"ç\" 를 사용하지 않기 때문에, \"açaí\"를 \"acai\"로 표기합니다. 따라 해 보세요.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"아사이는 어떤 맛이 나나요?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"아사이는 베리와 초콜릿 향이 섞인 맛입니다. 약간 시큼하고, 너무 달지 않고, 마치 블랙베리에 무가당 초콜릿을 섞은 것 같은 느낌입니다. 일반적으로 아사이는 오크베리 제품처럼 볼이나 스무디에 활용되며, 달콤한 과일이나 꿀과 함께 제공됩니다.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"아사이에 설탕이 들어있나요?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"오크베리 아사이에는 유기농 블루 아가베 시럽 및 유기농 흑설탕과 같은 천연 유기농 감미료가 포함되어 있습니다.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"아사이는 신맛이 강한가요?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"아사이는 산미가 강하지 않습니다. 약간 신맛이 나지만 대체로 중성이어서 소화에 부담이 적습니다. 오크베리에서는 브라질에서 바로 만든 느낌 그대로 즐길 수 있도록 아사이 베이스의 완벽한 제조 방법을 찾았습니다.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"아사이 색상이 다양할 수 있나요?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"현지에서 아사이를 유기농으로 수확하고 가공하기 때문에 열매의 색상이 다양 할 수 있습니다. 그래서 최종 제품의 색상도 조금씩 다를 수 있습니다. 이것은 정상적인 현상이며, 제조과정에서 유기농 천연 원료만을 사용하고 있음을 보여줍니다.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"아사이에 카페인이 들어 있나요?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"아사이 그 자체에는 카페인이 포함되어 있지 않습니다. 아사이는 항산화제와 영양분으로 유명하지만, 다른 열매나 과일처럼 카페인을 함유하고 있지 않습니다. 오크베리는 \"아사이 볼, 스무디 제품\"에 카페인을 첨가하지 않습니다. \u003cbr/\u003e ※ 일부 토핑에 카페인이 함유되어 있습니다. 주문 시 직원에게 문의하세요.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"개도 아사이를 먹을 수 있나요?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"아사이를 개에게 먹이면 해로울 것이라는 명확한 증거는 없지만, 반려동물에게 주기 전에 수의사와 상담하는 것이 좋습니다. 주요 제품에는 초콜릿이나 카페인이 첨가되어 있지는 않지만, 카카오닙스와 같은 토핑에 카페인이 함유되어 있습니다. \u003cbr/\u003e ※ 일부 토핑에 카페인이 함유되어 있습니다. 주문 시 직원에게

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language. English writes \"açaí\" as \"acai\" because English does not use the letter ç found in Portuguese. That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate. They're a bit tart and not too sweet, kind of like blackberries mixed with a touch of unsweetened chocolate. You'll usually find acai in smoothies or bowls, mixed with sweeter fruits or honey, just like in our offerings.","faq-topic-1-question-4-ask":"DOES YOUR ACAI HAVE SUGAR?","faq-topic-1-question-4-answer":"Our offerings contain organic natural sweeteners like organic brown sugar and organic blue agave syrup.","faq-topic-1-question-5-ask":"IS ACAI ACIDIC?","faq-topic-1-question-5-answer":"Acai berries are not notably acidic. They taste a bit tart but are mostly neutral, so they're easy on the stomach. At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

At OAKBERRY, we found the perfect balance on our acai base so you can enjoy the product like it is originally consumed in Brazil.","faq-topic-1-question-6-ask":"DOES ACAI VARY IN COLOR?","faq-topic-1-question-6-answer":"Because we locally harvest and process our açaí organically, the fruit can show different colors, hence, the final product can vary in color. This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits.

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

That is how you pronounce it.","faq-topic-1-question-3-ask":"WHAT DOES ACAI TASTE LIKE?","faq-topic-1-question-3-answer":"Acai berries taste like a mix of berries and a hint of chocolate.

The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand. Harvesters pick berries by hand, which is important for the economy in their areas.","faq-topic-1-question-2-ask":"HOW IS AÇAI PRONOUNCED?","faq-topic-1-question-2-answer":"You can pronounce acai or açaí as \"ah-sah-EE.\" \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eThe correct way to spell this word is Açaí, as it originates from the Portuguese language.

This is normal and shows that OAKBERRY only uses organic natural ingredients in our production process.","faq-topic-1-question-7-ask":"DOES ACAI HAVE CAFFEINE?","faq-topic-1-question-7-answer":"Açaí berries naturally do not contain caffeine. The açaí fruit is known for its  antioxidants and nutrition, but it doesn’t contain  caffeine like other berries or fruits. We don't add caffeine to our bowls and smoothies.","faq-topic-1-question-8-ask":"CAN DOGS EAT ACAI?","faq-topic-1-question-8-answer":"While there is no clear indication that açaí consumption will harm your dog, we recommend talking to your veterinarian before giving it to your pet .

This prompts the question, \"Where does acai come from?\" Well, it specifically comes from the Euterpe palm, a tree indigenous to the Amazon rainforest.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e The açaí pulp is a natural antioxidant that neutralizes free radicals. It contains minerals like Potassium and Calcium, Vitamin E, healthy fats like Omega 6 and 9, and proteins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e This popular fruit is now a major source of income for riverside communities because of the increasing global demand.
